# Automatic `needs-mac` Label Plan

Root bead: `ga-77idy2`  
Architecture source: `ga-hd99jq` D2, especially AF3 and AF4  
Incident source: `ga-xbilek` / PR #4844 / `d2142785f`

## Outcome

Build the narrow, add-only path policy. Architecture child `ga-77idy2.4`
approved an end-to-end event chain that uses only `github.token`, executes
only base-controlled workflow code, and dispatches the qualifying revision
explicitly after applying the visible label.

The architecture handoff assumed that a workflow could add `needs-mac` with
the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` and thereby wake
`dispatch-labeled-pr-suite.yml`. [GitHub's current `GITHUB_TOKEN`
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/security/github_token#when-github_token-triggers-workflow-runs)
states that token-caused `pull_request` `labeled` activity does not create a
workflow run. The original `pull_request` event also contains the pre-label
payload. A one-push PR could therefore display `needs-mac` while Mac Regression
never runs for that revision.

The approved response is to extend
`.github/workflows/dispatch-labeled-pr-suite.yml` with a second
`pull_request_target` job for the PR lifecycle events. That job evaluates the
path policy, adds the label, reuses extracted shared author-trust logic, and
calls `workflow_dispatch` itself for a trusted, non-draft same-repository PR.
It does not depend on the suppressed token-caused `labeled` event.

## Why the path list is narrow

The original candidate `cmd/gc/**` is too broad. The current tree contains 939
files under `cmd/gc`, and 1,297 distinct commits touched that directory in the
90-day retrospective window. The proposed initial policy covers 51 current
files and would have matched at most 81 distinct commits in the same window.
Those commit counts are an upper bound on qualifying PR revisions, not a
forecast of runner invocations, but they show why package-wide `cmd/gc`
matching is not acceptable for a scarce Mac lane.

Keep the whole of `internal/pathutil/**` and `internal/fsys/**`. Both are small,
cohesive packages whose purpose is path and filesystem behavior, so per-file
selection would be fragile without materially reducing the policy.

Use this initial allowlist:

```text
internal/pathutil/**
internal/fsys/**
internal/testutil/path.go
cmd/gc/path_*.go
cmd/gc/*_path*.go
cmd/gc/city_discovery*.go
cmd/gc/*worktree*.go
cmd/gc/cmd_supervisor_city*.go
.github/actions/setup-gascity-macos/**
**/*_darwin.go
**/*_darwin_test.go
```

Important negative controls:

- `cmd/gc/**` as a whole
- `cmd/gc/api_state*.go`, which is high-churn and the cited symlink defect is
  cross-platform rather than Mac-only
- generic `cmd/gc/*reaper*.go`, which sweeps unrelated cleanup mechanisms
- docs-only changes
- ordinary workflow changes, including
  `.github/workflows/dispatch-labeled-pr-suite.yml`

The original incident remains a mandatory positive fixture:
`cmd/gc/bead_worktree_reaper.go` matches through `cmd/gc/*worktree*.go`.

## Label lifecycle policy

- Evaluate the current net PR diff on `opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, and
  `ready_for_review`.
- Automatic application is limited to same-repository PRs. Fork PRs retain the
  existing manual-label path through the trusted dispatcher.
- A matching draft may receive the label, but existing draft gates must prevent
  Mac runner use until the PR becomes ready.
- Add `needs-mac` only when it is absent. An existing label is an idempotent
  no-op.
- Never auto-remove `needs-mac`. The workflow cannot reliably distinguish a
  human forcing Mac coverage from its own earlier label.
- A human can remove the label. A later matching `synchronize` event may add it
  again because each new revision is reevaluated.
- Every run reports one clear outcome: matched, already labeled, unmatched,
  draft-gated, or fork/manual fallback, including the matching policy family.

## Permission and trust boundary

`ga-77idy2.4` settled the complete chain:

- Extend the existing `pull_request_target` workflow to listen for `opened`,
  `reopened`, `synchronize`, and `ready_for_review`, while retaining `labeled`.
- Keep the current `dispatch-suite` job limited explicitly to `labeled`.
- Add an `auto-label-path-sensitive` job for the other actions. It rejects
  forks before doing work, checks out only `base.sha` with persisted
  credentials disabled, and lists changed files through the pull-request API.
- On a match, add `needs-mac` idempotently. A draft stops after labeling, so
  `ready_for_review` can reevaluate it later.
- Extract the existing association/allowlist decision into
  `.github/workflows/scripts/pr_trust_check.py` and call that same logic from
  both jobs. Do not create a second authorization policy.
- For a trusted non-draft PR, check for an in-flight or queued
  `mac-regression.yml` run at the exact head SHA, then dispatch
  `suite: needs-mac` with the existing PR/head inputs when none exists.
- Give the new job PR-scoped, cancel-in-progress concurrency so rapid
  synchronize events do not pile up, without sharing a group with the
  human-labeled job.

Permissions stay job-scoped:

- Existing `dispatch-suite`: `actions: write`, `contents: read`,
  `pull-requests: read`.
- New path-sensitive job: `actions: write`, `contents: read`,
  `pull-requests: write`.

The token is `github.token`. No PAT, GitHub App, new secret, or operator action
is needed. No PR-head code is checked out or executed with write credentials.
Fork PRs retain the existing manual-label path.

A qualifying trusted push is expected to create two workflow records: the
natural `pull_request` run, whose event snapshot predates the label and
correctly does not run a tier, and the explicit `workflow_dispatch` run that
executes the Mac suite. The head-SHA guard prevents two real dispatched suites;
the inert PR record is not a duplicate Mac execution.

## Child beads

| Order | Bead | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `ga-77idy2.4` | `gascity/architect` | Closed: approved the composed label-and-dispatch job with no new credential |
| 2 | `ga-77idy2.1` | `gascity/validator` | Pin the approved end-to-end chain, narrow path matrix, lifecycle, and security invariants |
| 3 | `ga-77idy2.2` | `gascity/builder` | Implement the approved automatic label plus trusted explicit dispatch |
| 4 | `ga-77idy2.3` | `gascity/builder` | Document the automatic behavior and manual fork fallback |

Dependency graph:

```text
ga-77idy2.4
  -> ga-77idy2.1
       -> ga-77idy2.2
            -> ga-77idy2.3
```

`ga-77idy2.4` is closed. The validator had already claimed `ga-77idy2.1`
during the interrupted first PM pass; it is now unblocked and has been
notified to resume against the architecture decision. The builder beads remain
blocked in order.

Duplicate children `ga-77idy2.5` and `ga-77idy2.6` were created during recovery
before the earlier children were discovered; both are closed as superseded.

## Acceptance summary

The work is complete when:

- a qualifying first same-repo PR revision causes the intended Mac Regression
  run, not merely a visible label;
- the tested allowlist catches the `ga-xbilek` path while unrelated
  `cmd/gc` work stays unmatched;
- new sensitive paths introduced by a later push are caught;
- the workflow never auto-removes a human-forced label;
- fork and draft behavior preserve the existing security and cost controls;
- no path hit directly flips `run_smoke` or `run_full`;
- no change touches ruleset 14017226;
- `ga-n7ef4e` retains ownership of `mac-regression.yml` gate mechanics; and
- the contributor design documentation matches the final architecture outcome.

## Out of scope

- Changing `mac-regression.yml` trigger or tier-gate logic
- Adding Mac Regression to required checks
- Modifying ruleset 14017226
- Direct path-based Mac gate bypass
- Automatically removing `needs-mac`
- Auto-labeling fork PRs without an explicit architecture revision

## Planning-system note

The repository moved internal PM artifacts to `engdocs/plans` in `512b066e8`.
The active PM prompt still names `docs/plans`; open bead `ga-f74ph9.1` owns that
pack-level correction. This artifact follows the current repository decision.
